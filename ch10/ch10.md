## System-Level I/O

### Unix I/O

- All I/O devices, such as networks, disks, and terminals, are modeled as files, and all input and output is performed by reading and writing the appropriate files
- This enables all input and output to be performed in a uniform and consistent way:
  - **Opening files**:
    - The kernel returns a small nonnegative integer, called a descriptor, that identifies the file in all subsequent operations on the file
    - The kernel keeps track of all information about the open file
    - The application only keeps track of the descriptor
    - Each process created by a Linux shell begins life with three open files:
      - standard input (descriptor 0)
      - standard output (descriptor 1)
      - standard error (descriptor 2)

  - **Changing the current file position**: 
    - The kernel maintains a file position k, initially 0, for each open file
    - An application can set the current file position k explicitly by performing a `seek` operation
  
  - **Reading and writing files**:
    - A read operation copies n > 0 bytes from a file to memory, starting at the current file position k and then incrementing k by n
    - A write operation copies n > 0 bytes from memory to a file, starting at the current file position k and then updating k
    - performing a read operation when k ≥ m triggers a condition known as end-of-file (EOF), which can be detected by the application
  
  - **Closing files**:
    - When a process terminates for any reason, the kernel closes all open files and frees their memory resources

### Files

- Each Linux file has a type that indicates its role in the system:
  - A regular file contains arbitrary data
  - A directory is a file consisting of an array of links, where each link maps a filename to a file, which may be another directory
  - A socket is a file that is used to communicate with another process across a network

- Each process has a current working directory that identifies its current location in the directory hierarchy (can use `cd` command to change in shell)

- An absolute pathname starts with a slash and denotes a path from the root node
- A relative pathname starts with a filename and denotes a path from the current working directory

### Opening and Closing Files

- A process **opens an existing file** or **creates a new file** by calling the open function:

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

// Returns: new file descriptor if OK, −1 on error
int open(char *filename, int flags, mode_t mode);
```

- The `open` function converts a filename to a file descriptor and returns the descriptor number

- The descriptor returned is always the smallest descriptor that is not currently open in the process. The flags argument indicates how the process intends to access the file:

```c
O_RDONLY. Reading only
O_WRONLY. Writing only
O_RDWR. Reading and writing
```

- A process closes an open file by calling the close function:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

// Returns: 0 if OK, −1 on error
int close(int fd);
```

- Closing a descriptor that is already closed is an error

### Reading and Writing Files

- Applications perform input and output by calling the read and write functions, respectively:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

// Returns: number of bytes read if OK, 0 on EOF, −1 on error
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t n);

// Returns: number of bytes written if OK, −1 on error
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t n);
```

- The read function copies at most `n` bytes from the current file position of descriptor `fd` to memory location `buf`
- The write function copies at most `n` bytes from memory location `buf` to the current file position of descriptor `fd`
- A program that uses read and write calls to copy the standard input to the standard output, 1 byte at a time:
- On x86-64 systems, a size_t is defined as an unsigned long, and an ssize_t (signed size) is defined as a long

```c
#include "csapp.h"

int main(void) {
  char c;
  while(Read(STDIN_FILENO, &c, 1) != 0)
    Write(STDOUT_FILENO, &c, 1);
  exit(0);
}
```

- In some situations, read and write transfer fewer bytes than the application requests. Such short counts do not indicate an error. They occur for a number of reasons:
  - **Encountering EOF on reads**
  - **Reading text lines from a terminal**
  - **Reading and writing network sockets**

### Robust Reading and Writing with the Rio Package

- `Rio` handles short counts automatically, it provides two different kinds of functions:
  - **Unbuffered input and output functions**: Transfer data directly between memory and a file, with no application-level buffering
  - **Buffered input functions**: These functions allow you to efficiently read text lines and binary data from a file whose contents are cached in an applicationlevel buffer, similar to the one provided for standard I/O functions such as `printf`. These functions are thread-safe and can be interleaved arbitrarily on the same descriptor

#### Rio Unbuffered Input and Output Functions

- Applications can transfer data directly between memory and a file by calling the `rio_readn` and `rio_writen` functions:

```c
#include "csapp.h"

// Returns: number of bytes transferred if OK, 0 on EOF (rio_readn only), −1 on error
ssize_t rio_readn(int fd, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
ssize_t rio_writen(int fd, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
```

- The rio_readn function can only return a short count if it encounters EOF
- The rio_writen function never returns a short count
- code for `rio_readn` and `rio_writen`:

```c
ssize_t rio_readn(int fd, void *usrbuf, size_t n) {
  size_t nleft = n;
  ssize_t nread;
  char *bufp = usrbuf;

  while (nleft > 0) {
    if ((nread = read(fd, bufp, nleft)) < 0) {
      if (errno == EINTR) /* Interrupted by sig handler return */
        nread = 0; /* and call read() again */
      else
        return -1; /* errno set by read() */
    }
    else if (nread == 0)
      break; /* EOF */
    nleft -= nread;
    bufp += nread;
  }
  return (n - nleft); /* Return >= 0 */
}

ssize_t rio_writen(int fd, void *usrbuf, size_t n) {
  size_t nleft = n;
  ssize_t nwritten;
  char *bufp = usrbuf;

  while (nleft > 0) {
    if ((nwritten = write(fd, bufp, nleft)) <= 0) {
      if (errno == EINTR) /* Interrupted by sig handler return */
        nwritten = 0; /* and call write() again */
      else
        return -1; /* errno set by write() */
    }
    nleft -= nwritten;
    bufp += nwritten;
  }
  return n;
}
```

- Notice that each function manually restarts the read or write function if it is interrupted by the return from an application signal handler

#### Rio Buffered Input Functions

```c
#include "csapp.h"

// Returns: nothing
void rio_readinitb(rio_t *rp, int fd);

// Returns: number of bytes read if OK, 0 on EOF, −1 on error
ssize_t rio_readlineb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t maxlen);
ssize_t rio_readnb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t n);
```

- It associates the descriptor `fd` with a read buffer of type `rio_t` at address `rp`
- Calls to these buffered functions should not be interleaved with calls to the unbuffered `rio_readn` function
- The `rio_readinitb` function sets up an empty read buffer and associates an open file descriptor with that buffer

- Copying a text file from standard input to standard output:

```c
#include "csapp.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int n;
  rio_t rio;
  char buf[MAXLINE];

  Rio_readinitb(&rio, STDIN_FILENO);
  while((n = Rio_readlineb(&rio, buf, MAXLINE)) != 0)
    Rio_writen(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, n);
}
```

- A read buffer of type `rio_t` and the `rio_readinitb`:

```c
#define RIO_BUFSIZE 8192
typedef struct {
  int rio_fd; /* Descriptor for this internal buf */
  int rio_cnt; /* Unread bytes in internal buf */
  char *rio_bufptr; /* Next unread byte in internal buf */
  char rio_buf[RIO_BUFSIZE]; /* Internal buffer */
} rio_t;

void rio_readinitb(rio_t *rp, int fd) {
  rp->rio_fd = fd;
  rp->rio_cnt = 0;
  rp->rio_bufptr = rp->rio_buf;
}
```

- The heart of the Rio read routines is the `rio_read` function:

```c
static ssize_t rio_read(rio_t *rp, char *usrbuf, size_t n) {
  int cnt;
  while (rp->rio_cnt <= 0) { /* Refill if buf is empty */
    rp->rio_cnt = read(rp->rio_fd, rp->rio_buf,
    sizeof(rp->rio_buf));
    if (rp->rio_cnt < 0) {
      if (errno != EINTR) /* Interrupted by sig handler return */
        return -1;
    } else if (rp->rio_cnt == 0) /* EOF */
      return 0;
    else
      rp->rio_bufptr = rp->rio_buf; /* Reset buffer ptr */
  }

  /* Copy min(n, rp->rio_cnt) bytes from internal buf to user buf */
  cnt = n;
  if (rp->rio_cnt < n)
    cnt = rp->rio_cnt;
  memcpy(usrbuf, rp->rio_bufptr, cnt);
  rp->rio_bufptr += cnt;
  rp->rio_cnt -= cnt;
  return cnt;
}
```

- The `rio_read` function is a buffered version of the Linux `read` function
- It returns a short count if the number of requested bytes exceeds the number of unread bytes in the read buffer
- The `rio_readnb` has the same structure as `rio_readn`, with `rio_read` substituted for `read`:

```c
ssize_t rio_readnb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t n) {
  size_t nleft = n;
  ssize_t nread;
  char *bufp = usrbuf;

  while (nleft > 0) {
    if ((nread = rio_read(rp, bufp, nleft)) < 0)
      return -1; /* errno set by read() */
    else if (nread == 0)
      break; /* EOF */
    nleft -= nread;
    bufp += nread;
  }
  return (n - nleft); /* Return >= 0 */
}
```

- Similarly, the `rio_readlineb` calls `rio_read` at most `maxlen-1` times:

```c
ssize_t rio_readlineb(rio_t *rp, void *usrbuf, size_t maxlen) {
  int n, rc;
  char c, *bufp = usrbuf;
  for (n = 1; n < maxlen; n++) {
    if ((rc = rio_read(rp, &c, 1)) == 1) {
      *bufp++ = c;
      if (c == ’\n’) {
        n++;
        break;
      }
    } else if (rc == 0) {
      if (n == 1)
        return 0; /* EOF, no data read */
      else
        break; /* EOF, some data was read */
    } else
      return -1; /* Error */
  }
  *bufp = 0;
  return n-1;
}
```

### Reading File Metadata

- An application can retrieve information about a file (sometimes called the file’s metadata) by calling the `stat` and `fstat` functions:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

// Returns: 0 if OK, −1 on error
int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf);
```

- Metadata returned by the stat and fstat functions:

```c
struct stat {
  dev_t st_dev; /* Device */
  ino_t st_ino; /* inode */
  mode_t st_mode; /* Protection and file type */
  nlink_t st_nlink; /* Number of hard links */
  uid_t st_uid; /* User ID of owner */
  gid_t st_gid; /* Group ID of owner */
  dev_t st_rdev; /* Device type (if inode device) */
  off_t st_size; /* Total size, in bytes */
  unsigned long st_blksize; /* Block size for filesystem I/O */
  unsigned long st_blocks; /* Number of blocks allocated */
  time_t st_atime; /* Time of last access */
  time_t st_mtime; /* Time of last modification */
  time_t st_ctime; /* Time of last change */
};
```

- The `st_size` member contains the file size in bytes
- The `st_mode` member encodes both the file permission bits and the file type

- eg. how we might use macros and the stat function to read and interpret a file's `st_mode` bits:

```c
#include "csapp.h"

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
  struct stat stat;
  char *type, *readok;

  Stat(argv[1], &stat);
  if (S_ISREG(stat.st_mode)) /* Determine file type */
    type = "regular";
  else if (S_ISDIR(stat.st_mode))
    type = "directory";
  else
    type = "other";

  if ((stat.st_mode & S_IRUSR)) /* Check read access */
    readok = "yes";
  else
    readok = "no";

  printf("type: %s, read: %s\n", type, readok);
  exit(0);
}
```
