## Concurrent Programming

- Application-level concurrency is useful in some ways:
  - Accessing slow I/O devices
  - Interacting with humans
  - Reducing latency by deferring work
  - Servicing multiple network clients
  - Computing in parallel on multi-core machines
- Modern operating systems provide three basic approaches for building concurrent programs:
  - **Processes**: Since processes have separate virtual address spaces, flows that want to communicate with each other must use some kind of explicit **interprocess communication (IPC)** mechanism
  - **I/O multiplexing**: Logical flows are modeled as state machines that the main program explicitly transitions from state to state as a result of data arriving on file descriptors. Since the program is a single process, all flows share the same address space
  - **Threads**: Threads are logical flows that run in the context of a single process and are scheduled by the kernel

### Concurrent Programming with Processes

- A natural approach for building a concurrent server is to accept client connection requests in the parent and then create a new child process to service each new client
- How this might work:

![](./server_client_connection_steps.png)

![](./server_client_connection_steps_2.png)

- Code for a concurrent echo server based on processes (The parent forks a child to handle each new connection request):

```c
#include "csapp.h"

void echo(int connfd);

void sigchld_handler(int sig) {
  while (waitpid(-1, 0, WNOHANG) > 0)
    ;
  return;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int listenfd, connfd;
  socklen_t clientlen;
  struct sockaddr_storage clientaddr;

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <port>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }

  Signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);
  listenfd = Open_listenfd(argv[1]);
  while (1) {
    clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage);
    connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *) &clientaddr, &clientlen);
    if (Fork() == 0) {
      Close(listenfd);   /* Child closes its listening socket */
      echo(connfd);      /* Child services client */
      Close(connfd);     /* Child closes connection with client */
      exit(0);           /* Child exits */
    }
    Close(connfd); /* Parent closes connected socket (important!) */
  }
}
```

- Pros and cons of processes
  - Processes have a clean model for sharing state information between parents and children: file tables are shared and user address spaces are not
  - Separate address spaces make it more difficult for processes to share state information
  - Another disadvantage of process-based designs is that they tend to be slower because the overhead for process control and IPC is high

### Concurrent Programming with I/O Multiplexing

- The basic idea is to use the `select` function to ask the kernel to suspend the process, returning control to the application only after one or more I/O events have occurred, as in the following examples:
  - Return when any descriptor in the set {0, 4} is ready for reading
  - Return when any descriptor in the set {1, 2, 7} is ready for writing
  - Time out if 152.13 seconds have elapsed waiting for an I/O event to occur

- `select` is a complicated function with many different usage scenarios. We will only discuss the first scenario: waiting for a set of descriptors to be ready for reading:

```c
#include <sys/select.h>

// Returns: nonzero count of ready descriptors, −1 on error
int select(int n, fd_set *fdset, NULL, NULL, NULL);

// Macros for manipulating descriptor sets
FD_ZERO(fd_set *fdset); /* Clear all bits in fdset */
FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *fdset); /* Clear bit fd in fdset */
FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *fdset); /* Turn on bit fd in fdset */
FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *fdset); /* Is bit fd in fdset on? */
```

- `select` function takes two inputs:
  - A descriptor set(fdset) called the read set
  - The cardinality (n) of the read set (actually the maximum cardinality of any descriptor set)

- A descriptor `k` is ready for reading if and only if a request to read 1 byte from that descriptor would not block
- How we might use select to implement an iterative echo server that also accepts user commands on the standard input:

```c
#include "csapp.h"
void echo(int connfd);
void command(void);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int listenfd, connfd;
  socklen_t clientlen;
  struct sockaddr_storage clientaddr;
  fd_set read_set, ready_set;
  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <port>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }
  listenfd = Open_listenfd(argv[1]);

  FD_ZERO(&read_set); /* Clear read set */
  FD_SET(STDIN_FILENO, &read_set); /* Add stdin to read set */
  FD_SET(listenfd, &read_set); /* Add listenfd to read set */

  while (1) {
    ready_set = read_set;
    Select(listenfd+1, &ready_set, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    if (FD_ISSET(STDIN_FILENO, &ready_set))
      command(); /* Read command line from stdin */
    if (FD_ISSET(listenfd, &ready_set)) {
      clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage);
      connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);
      echo(connfd); /* Echo client input until EOF */
      Close(connfd);
    }
  }
}

void command(void) {
  char buf[MAXLINE];
  if (!Fgets(buf, MAXLINE, stdin))
    exit(0); /* EOF */
  printf("%s", buf); /* Process the input command */
}
```

- Initially we using `FD_ZERO` to create an empty read set:

![](./iterative_echo_server_eg_1.png)

- Then we define the read set to consist of descriptor 0 and descriptor 3

![](./iterative_echo_server_eg_2.png)

- Instead of waiting for a connection request by calling the accept function, we call the select function, which blocks until either the listening descriptor or standard input is ready for reading

![](./iterative_echo_server_eg_3.png)

- The program's problem is that once it connects to a client, it continues echoing input lines until the client closes its end of the connection
  - Thus, if you type a command to standard input, you will not get a response until the server is finished with the client
  - A better approach would be to multiplex at a finer granularity, echoing (at most) one text line each time through the server loop

#### A Concurrent Event-Driven Server Based on I/O Mutiplexing

- Informally, a state machine is a collection of states, input events, and transitions that map states and input events to states
- State machines are typically drawn as directed graphs, where nodes represent states, directed arcs represent transitions, and arc labels represent input events

![](./state_machine_for_event_driven_echo_server.png)

- Concurrent echo server based on I/O multiplexing:

```c
#include "csapp.h"

typedef struct { /* Represents a pool of connected descriptors */
  int maxfd; /* Largest descriptor in read_set */
  fd_set read_set; /* Set of all active descriptors */
  fd_set ready_set; /* Subset of descriptors ready for reading */
  int nready; /* Number of ready descriptors from select */
  int maxi; /* High water index into client array */
  int clientfd[FD_SETSIZE]; /* Set of active descriptors */
  rio_t clientrio[FD_SETSIZE]; /* Set of active read buffers */
} pool;

int byte_cnt = 0; /* Counts total bytes received by server */

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int listenfd, connfd;
  socklen_t clientlen;
  struct sockaddr_storage clientaddr;
  static pool pool;

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <port>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }
  listenfd = Open_listenfd(argv[1]);
  init_pool(listenfd, &pool);

  while (1) {
    /* Wait for listening/connected descriptor(s) to become ready */
    pool.ready_set = pool.read_set;
    pool.nready = Select(pool.maxfd+1, &pool.ready_set, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    /* If listening descriptor ready, add new client to pool */
    if (FD_ISSET(listenfd, &pool.ready_set)) {
      clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage);
      connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);
      add_client(connfd, &pool);
    }

    /* Echo a text line from each ready connected descriptor */
    check_clients(&pool);
  }
}

void init_pool(int listenfd, pool *p) {
  /* Initially, there are no connected descriptors */
  int i;
  p->maxi = -1;
  for (i=0; i< FD_SETSIZE; i++)
    p->clientfd[i] = -1;

  /* Initially, listenfd is only member of select read set */
  p->maxfd = listenfd;
  FD_ZERO(&p->read_set);
  FD_SET(listenfd, &p->read_set);
}

void add_client(int connfd, pool *p) {
  int i;
  p->nready--;
  for (i = 0; i < FD_SETSIZE; i++) /* Find an available slot */
    if (p->clientfd[i] < 0) {
      /* Add connected descriptor to the pool */
      p->clientfd[i] = connfd;
      Rio_readinitb(&p->clientrio[i], connfd);

      /* Add the descriptor to descriptor set */
      FD_SET(connfd, &p->read_set);

      /* Update max descriptor and pool high water mark */
      if (connfd > p->maxfd)
        p->maxfd = connfd;
      if (i > p->maxi)
        p->maxi = i;
      break;
    }
  if (i == FD_SETSIZE) /* Couldn’t find an empty slot */
    app_error("add_client error: Too many clients");
}

void check_clients(pool *p) {
  int i, connfd, n;
  char buf[MAXLINE];
  rio_t rio;
  for (i = 0; (i <= p->maxi) && (p->nready > 0); i++) {
    connfd = p->clientfd[i];
    rio = p->clientrio[i];

    /* If the descriptor is ready, echo a text line from it */
    if ((connfd > 0) && (FD_ISSET(connfd, &p->ready_set))) {
      p->nready--;
      if ((n = Rio_readlineb(&rio, buf, MAXLINE)) != 0) {
        byte_cnt += n;
        printf("Server received %d (%d total) bytes on fd %d\n",
        n, byte_cnt, connfd);
        Rio_writen(connfd, buf, n);
      }

      /* EOF detected, remove descriptor from pool */
      else {
        Close(connfd);
        FD_CLR(connfd, &p->read_set);
        p->clientfd[i] = -1;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pros and Cons of I/O Multiplexing

- Pros:
  - Give programmers more control over the behavior of their programs than process-based designs
  - Every logical flow has access to the entire address space of the process
  - Do not require a process context switch to schedule a new flow
- Cons:
  - Coding complexity
  - Complexity increases as the granularity of the concurrency decreases (By granularity, we mean the number of instructions that each logical flow executes per time slice)
  - Event-based cannot fully utilize multi-core processors

### Concurrent Programming with Threads

- A **thread** is a logical flow that runs in the context of a process
- The threads are scheduled automatically by the kernel
  - Each thread has its own thread context, including a unique integer thread ID (TID), stack, stack pointer, program counter, general-purpose registers, and condition codes
  - All threads running in a process share the entire virtual address space of that process

#### Thread Execution Model

- The execution model for multiple threads is similar in some ways to the execution model for multiple processes, eg

![](./concurrent_thread_execution.png)

- Because a thread context is much smaller than a process context, a thread context switch is faster than a process context switch
- The threads associated with a process form a pool of peers, independent of which threads were created by which other threads
- The main thread is distinguished from other threads only in the sense that it is always the first thread to run in the process
- The main impact of this notion of a pool of peers is that a thread can kill any of its peers or wait for any of its peers to terminate

#### Posix Threads

- Posix threads (Pthreads) is a standard interface for manipulating threads from C programs
- The Pthreads "Hello world!" program:

```c
#include "csapp.h"
void *thread(void *vargp);

int main() {
  pthread_t tid;
  Pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, NULL);
  Pthread_join(tid, NULL);
  exit(0);
}

void *thread(void *vargp) { /* Thread routine */
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return NULL;
}
```

- The code and local data for a thread are encapsulated in a thread routine. Each thread routine takes as input a single generic pointer and returns a generic pointer
- The main thread waits for the peer thread to terminate with the call to `pthread_join`

#### Creating Threads

- Threads create other threads by calling the pthread_create function:

```c
#include <pthread.h>

typedef void *(func)(void *);

// Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero on error
int pthread_create(pthread_t *tid, pthread_attr_t *attr, func *f, void *arg);
```

- The `pthread_create` function creates a new thread and runs the thread routine `f` in the context of the new thread and with an input argument of `arg`
- The attr argument can be used to change the default attributes of the newly created thread

- The new thread can determine its own thread ID by calling the `pthread_self` function:

```c
#include <pthread.h>

// Returns: thread ID of caller
pthread_t pthread_self(void);
```

#### Terminating Threads

- A thread terminates in one of the following ways:
  - The thread terminates implicitly when its top-level thread routine returns
  - The thread terminates explicitly by calling the `pthread_exit` function. If the main thread calls `pthread_exit`, it waits for all other peer threads to terminate and then terminates the main thread and the entire process with a return value of `thread_return`
  
  ```c
  #include <pthread.h>
  // Never returns
  void pthread_exit(void *thread_return);
  ```

  - Some peer thread calls the Linux `exit` function, which terminates the process and all threads associated with the process
  - Another peer thread terminates the current thread by calling the `pthread_cancel` function with the ID of the current thread:

  ```c
  #include <pthread.h>
  // Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero on error
  int pthread_cancel(pthread_t tid);
  ```

#### Reaping Terminated Threads

- Threads wait for other threads to terminate by calling the `pthread_join` function:

```c
#include <pthread.h>

// Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero on error
int pthread_join(pthread_t tid, void **thread_return);
```

- The pthread_join function blocks until thread tid terminates, assigns the generic `(void *)` pointer returned by the thread routine to the location pointed to by `thread_return`, and then **reaps any memory resources held by the terminated thread**

#### Detaching Threads

- At any point in time, a thread is **joinable** or **detached**
- In contrast with joinable thread, a detached thread cannot be reaped or killed by other threads
- Its memory resources are freed automatically by the system when it terminates
- By default, threads are created joinable. In order to avoid memory leaks, each joinable thread should be either explicitly reaped by another thread or detached by a call to the `pthread_detach` function:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
// Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero on error
int pthread_detach(pthread_t tid);
```

#### Initializing Threads

- The `pthread_once` function allows you to initialize the state associated with a thread routine:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
pthread_once_t once_control = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;

// Always returns 0
int pthread_once(pthread_once_t *once_control,void (*init_routine)(void));
```
