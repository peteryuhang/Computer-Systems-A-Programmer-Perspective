## Concurrent Programming

- Application-level concurrency is useful in some ways:
  - Accessing slow I/O devices
  - Interacting with humans
  - Reducing latency by deferring work
  - Servicing multiple network clients
  - Computing in parallel on multi-core machines
- Modern operating systems provide three basic approaches for building concurrent programs:
  - **Processes**: Since processes have separate virtual address spaces, flows that want to communicate with each other must use some kind of explicit **interprocess communication (IPC)** mechanism
  - **I/O multiplexing**: Logical flows are modeled as state machines that the main program explicitly transitions from state to state as a result of data arriving on file descriptors. Since the program is a single process, all flows share the same address space
  - **Threads**: Threads are logical flows that run in the context of a single process and are scheduled by the kernel

### Concurrent Programming with Processes

- A natural approach for building a concurrent server is to accept client connection requests in the parent and then create a new child process to service each new client
- How this might work:

- Code for a concurrent echo server based on processes (The parent forks a child to handle each new connection request):

```c
#include "csapp.h"

void echo(int connfd);

void sigchld_handler(int sig) {
  while (waitpid(-1, 0, WNOHANG) > 0)
    ;
  return;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int listenfd, connfd;
  socklen_t clientlen;
  struct sockaddr_storage clientaddr;

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <port>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }

  Signal(SIGCHLD, sigchld_handler);
  listenfd = Open_listenfd(argv[1]);
  while (1) {
    clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage);
    connfd = Accept(listenfd, (SA *) &clientaddr, &clientlen);
    if (Fork() == 0) {
      Close(listenfd);   /* Child closes its listening socket */
      echo(connfd);      /* Child services client */
      Close(connfd);     /* Child closes connection with client */
      exit(0);           /* Child exits */
    }
    Close(connfd); /* Parent closes connected socket (important!) */
  }
}
```

- Pros and cons of processes
  - Processes have a clean model for sharing state information between parents and children: file tables are shared and user address spaces are not
  - Separate address spaces make it more difficult for processes to share state information
  - Another disadvantage of process-based designs is that they tend to be slower because the overhead for process control and IPC is high
