## Concurrent Programming

- Application-level concurrency is useful in some ways:
  - Accessing slow I/O devices
  - Interacting with humans
  - Reducing latency by deferring work
  - Servicing multiple network clients
  - Computing in parallel on multi-core machines
- Modern operating systems provide three basic approaches for building concurrent programs:
  - **Processes**: Since processes have separate virtual address spaces, flows that want to communicate with each other must use some kind of explicit **interprocess communication (IPC)** mechanism
  - **I/O multiplexing**: Logical flows are modeled as state machines that the main program explicitly transitions from state to state as a result of data arriving on file descriptors. Since the program is a single process, all flows share the same address space
  - **Threads**: Threads are logical flows that run in the context of a single process and are scheduled by the kernel
