## The Memory Hierarchy

- Memory system is a hierarchy of storage devices with different capacities, costs, and access time
- If stored in a cache, 4 to 75 cycles. If store in main memory, hundreds of cycles. And if stored in disk, tens of millions of cycles

### Storage Technologies

#### Random Access Memory

- RAM
  - SRAM
  - DRAM

##### Static RAM

- SRAM stores each bit in a bistable memory cell
- Due to its bistable nature, an SRAM memory cell will retain its value indefinitely, as long as it is kept powered
