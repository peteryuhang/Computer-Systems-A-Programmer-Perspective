## Network Programming

### The Client-Server Programming Model

- It is important to realize that clients and servers are processes and not machines, or hosts as they are often called in this context

### Networks

- Hardware organization:

- Data received from the network are copied from the adapter across the I/O and memory buses into memory, typically by a DMA transfer

- An **Ethernet segment** consists of some wires (usually twisted pairs of wires) and a small box called a **hub**:

- Every host adapter sees the frame, but only the destination host actually reads it
- Multiple Ethernet segments can be connected into larger LANs, called **bridged Ethernets**, using a set of wires and small boxes called bridges:

- Using a clever distributed algorithm, they automatically learn over time which hosts are reachable from which ports and then selectively copy frames from one port to another only when it is necessary

- At a higher level in the hierarchy, multiple incompatible LANs can be connected by specialized computers called routersto form an internet (interconnected network)

- The crucial property of an internet is that it can consist of different LANs and WANs with radically different and incompatible technologies:
