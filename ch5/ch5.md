## Optimizing Program Performance

- Writing an efficient program requires several types of activities
  1. Select an appropriate set of algorithms and data structures
  2. Write source code that the compiler can effectively optimize to turn into efficient executable code
  3. Divide a task  into protions that can be computed in parallel
